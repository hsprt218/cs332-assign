Ch 1.
Large-scale software projects often become unexpectedly complex, leading to delays and failures, yet programming offers creative rewards
•	Large-scale systems->Complexity, entanglement
•	Project management: Missed goals, deadlines, budgets
•	Small vs. large efforts==Individual programming vs. team efforts
•	Challenges: Coordination, system integration, unexpected issues
•	Rewards: Creativity, problem-solving, learning
•	Systems programming: Prone to delays, underestimated

Ch 2.
Adding more manpower to a delayed software project exacerbates delays due to increased communication and coordination overhead
•	Mythical man-month: Non-linear relationship between time and resources
•	Brooks’s Law: Manpower increases delays
•	Issues: Communication overhead, training, slowed progress
•	Sequential tasks: Non-parallelizable, delays persist
•	Effective management: Small skilled teams, realistic planning, conceptual integrity
•	Common mistakes: Optimism in scheduling, effort vs. progress confusion, poor monitoring
